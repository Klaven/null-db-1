# The Null Database

Here are a collection of databases created for learning and education. These databases look to show how popular databases like mongo, dynamo, postgress and cassandra work, and should help expand your understanding and knowledge of not only how it is done, but why it effects you.

## This is WIP

I am working on this in my spare time. please, consume it at your own risk. :) if you would like the more guided approach then please watch my video series on it.


## Goal

To have THE best set of examples and educational content on why/when and how databases and data work. From storage, to transmission and the issues and trade offs made.

## Contributions

To be honest, right now you are more then welcome to make a PR, and if you want to make exampels in some other language please feel free to make those PR's. That being said the core databases are too young and new to have really meaningful contributions yet.
